## Inspiration
There is a growing amount of pollution in our atmosphere. Not many people are aware about the dangers it can pose to their health and the environment. We want to make information about the level of pollution to the general public be easily accessible and increase public awareness.

## Target Users
Our targets users are individuals who are concerned about the air quality in their areas, people with breathing issues such as asthma and bronchitis, pollution-conscious car drivers, and eco-conscious business owners.

## How it works
The application extracts information from the United State's EPA airnow dataset and presents it in a intuitive manner on the watch face. It uses your phone's GPS to determine the user's current location. It updates the Air Quality Index every 15 minutes. Additionally, the application has a health category system that helps the user understand the severity of pollution in the air.

## Challenges we ran into
Since this is our first time at a Hackatron, we had a steep learning curve. We had to learn C, Javascript and version control using Github. We had issues with debugging the graphic user interface, understanding what each component in the source code does and how the C file in the application communicates with its Javascript file.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of the fact we are able to make a working watch application and a presentable graphic user interface in a team environment. We are also proud that it is able to synchronize and update with the airnow EPA dataset.

## What's next for PebbleEco
We want to expand our dataset to include other countries like Canada. We also want to include statistics such as average daily AQI.
